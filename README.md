# LoRaWAN playground

Playing around with the [edu-kit](http://docs.edu-kit.de/) for the [HanseHack](https://hansehack.de/).

Code is based on http://docs.edu-kit.de/lora/lorasketch/

## Getting started

Copy `lora_credentials.example.h` to `lora_credentials.h` and put in your credentials you received
from your network provider. `lora_credentials.h` is on `.gitignore` so won't be commited unwantedly.
